# Allo-Allo

The `Allo-Allo` reusable action is located at [`./workflows/allo-allo.yml`](https://github.com/anolilab/workflows/tree/main/workflows/allo-allo.yml).

This workflow is added to repositories to welcome new contributors and congratulate them on their first successful pull request merge.
You can specify all three inputs or a single input depending on your needs.

This reusable action depends on the following actions:

- [welcome-bot](https://github.com/actions/first-interaction)

## Inputs

The action has the following inputs:

### Required inputs

#### target-repo

Specify the target repository this action should run on. This is used to prevent actions from running on repositories other than the target repository. For example, specifying a `target-repo` of `anolilab/workflows` will prevent the action from running on forks of `anolilab/workflows`.

- This `input` is required

### Optional inputs

#### issue-welcome

Message to show to a contributor opening their first issue.

- This `input` is optional.

#### pr-welcome

Message to show to a contributor opening their first pull request.

- This `input` is optional.

#### pr-merged

Message to show to a contributor after first merged pull request.

- This `input` is optional.
