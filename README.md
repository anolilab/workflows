# Shared GitHub Actions

This repository serves as a collection of reusable GitHub Action workflows specifically designed for usage in Node and Monorepo projects.
The workflows stored here encapsulate common and repetitive tasks, allowing them to be easily integrated into multiple projects.
This not only reduces the necessity to rewrite code, but also ensures a standardized approach to common operations across all repositories.
